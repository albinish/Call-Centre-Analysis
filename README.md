2. Customer Satisfaction Monitoring: Provided insights into overall customer satisfaction scores, helping to identify areas for service improvement.

3. Agent Performance Tracking: Analyzed individual agent performance through metrics such as average handle time, speed of answer, and calls answered, allowing for targeted training and support.

4. Time-Based Call Distribution: Visualized call volumes by time to optimize staffing schedules and reduce wait times.

5. Operational Insights: Included metrics like average speed of answer and issue resolution rates, highlighting opportunities to streamline processes and enhance customer interactions.
